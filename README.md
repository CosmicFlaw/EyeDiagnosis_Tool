# Introduction

Hi, I’m @CosmicFlaw
I am a **hobbyist developer** working across various fields like *game development, full stack web development, AI models, machine learning and robotics.*
I usually work as the programmer in all these fields. 

Here are some details for my Programming Languages Proficiency:
> **Intermediate:** Python, HTML, CSS, C, GDScript (for Godot)

> **Beginner:** C++, Javascript, SQL

I have always been interested in programming, but apart from that I love making 3D models in blender, digital art (somewhat) in Krita and making Games in Godot.

- I’m currently learning to master full stack web dev and machine learning because I still have a few things to cover in that subject
- I’m looking to collaborate on... right now, nothing but soon enough, I am planning to build some *very, very* ambititous projects and I hope you will agree to collaborating with me.

You can find me as CosmicFlaw in StackOverflow, Itch.io and anywhere wherever I be... I will be happy to help.
